# Cloud Computing - Lab 3

To better understand a monolithic application, let’s dive into a small practical example.

We’ll provide a small Flask app that uses HTML for front-end and SQLite3 as the database.

Why Is This a Monolithic Application?

In this setup:
- All services (UI, business logic, and database) run within a single process.
- The entire application is tightly coupled and works as a single cohesive unit.

The code for this practical will be provided as part of the lab.
